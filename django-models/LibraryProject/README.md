# Django ORM Learning Project

This project is a minimal Django setup designed to help understand and experiment with Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) capabilities. The Django ORM provides a powerful and intuitive way to interact with databases, allowing developers to create, retrieve, update, and delete records with ease, using Python code instead of raw SQL.
